## Introduction
The Quickest Path project aims to develop a software solution that calculates the fastest path between two nodes based on data provided in a CSV file.

## Objectives
- Develop an efficient algorithm to find the quickest path.
- Ensure the software can handle large datasets.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for input and output.

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- Import data from a CSV file.
- Calculate the quickest path between two nodes.
- Display the results to the user.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Performance: The software should process data efficiently.
- Usability: The interface should be intuitive and easy to use.
- Scalability: The system should handle increasing amounts of data.

## System Architecture
### Overview
- **Input:** CSV file containing node connections and times.
- **Processing:** Algorithm to calculate the quickest path.
- **Output:** Display of the quickest path and time.

### Components
1. **Data Importer:** Reads and parses the CSV file.
2. **Path Calculator:** Implements the algorithm to find the quickest path.
3. **User Interface:** Allows users to input nodes and view results.

## Data Handling
### CSV File Format
- **Columns:** ID_1, ID_2, Time
- **Example:**
    ```
    ID_1,ID_2,Time
    1,2,1000
    2,3,1500
    ```

### Data Validation
- Ensure all rows have valid numeric values.
- Check for missing or duplicate entries.

## Algorithm
