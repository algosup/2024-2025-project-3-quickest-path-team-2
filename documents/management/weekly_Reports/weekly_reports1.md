# Weekly Report Project: "Quickest Path". 
# Week 1 (6th of january to 10th of january).

## Overview

### Project discovery

This week our client gave us the call for tender in which we must produce an algoritm able to calculate in time the quickest path between two landmarks in this case the roads of the United States of America.

### Research procedure

Since it's the beggining of a new project, research is mandatory to ensure that all requirements are understood with clarity by all team members.

Most of us doesn't know how to create an algorithm, therefore we have done research about which type of algorithm shall we produce precisely. 

### Conventions and organisation

#### Coding covention

The different coding conventions have been initiated to ensure clarity and conformity of the code and to ensure no issues arise from code discrepancies.

#### Folder organisation and conventions

The overall project organisation has been structured for coordination between team members.

*the entirety of the conventions are written on the technical specification*


### Data validation tool

A first version of the data validation tool has been produced to check if all informations in the datasource are correct.

### Signature system

For copyright purposes we established two different signatures, one obvious and the other one hidden so no one can just delete them of our code.


## Project Planning and management

### KPI'S management 

| KPI's                    | Progress |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Research                 | 100%     |
| Functional specification | 5%       |
| Technical specification  | 15%      |
| Test Plan                | 0%       |
| Data Validation Tool     | 90%      |
| User manual              | 0%      |
|Pre procession            | 0%      |
| Algorithm development    | 0%       |
| REST API development     | 0%       |
| Weekly Reports           | 20%      |

### Gantt Charts

A Gantt chart has been initiated to manage the project schedule in the most adventageous conditions as possible for our team.

A Gantt chart specific to the different aspects of the project code as also been added.

### Team members time management
To follow-up team's time management, a table has been created allowing us:

- Track The different project times
- Record team's overtime and absences
- Calculate how much time team members have to catch up

## Objectives for next week

Our objectives for next week are :
- Do most of the functional specification and Test Plan.

- Start developing the algorithm
