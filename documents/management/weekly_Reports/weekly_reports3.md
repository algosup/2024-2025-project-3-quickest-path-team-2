# Weekly Report Project: "Quickest Path". 
# Week 3 (20th of January to 24th of January).

## Overview

### Technical Specification

Thanks to the early accomplishment of the functional specification, the technical specification has been finished swiftly after, allowing a quick focus on the Algorithm and API.

### Test Plan

The Test Plan is still unfinished and needs additional time to be completed.

### Programs pre-processing

The pre-processing of the system has been finished.

### The API

The API has been started using [Crow API services](https://github.com/CrowCpp/Crow). It's working as inted, now it just need to be merged with the rest of the code so it will work with our algorithm.

### The Algorithm

Our Algorithm is currently finding the different path at a maximum of 10 seconds, we are coming closer to reach the under 1 second criteria imposed by the call for tender.

## Project Planning and management

### KPI'S management 

| KPI's                    | Progress |
| ------------------------ | -------- |
| Research                 | 100%     |
| Functional specification | 100%     |
| Technical specification  | 95%      |
| Test Plan                | 90%      |
| Data Validation Tool     | 90%      |
| User manual              | 50%      |
|Pre procession            | 100%     |
| Algorithm development    | 70%       |
| REST API development     | 80%      |
| Weekly Reports           | 60%      |


### README

The [**README**] has been filled, ginving details on the program and how to launch it.

### Critical path

A [**critical path**](/documents/management/documents/Critical_Path.pdf) has been created.

## Objectives for next week

Next week we should finish the Test plan and possibly the User manual, after that the algorithm should at least be able to find any path under 3 second or finish it so it goes under 1 seconds like asked in the call for tender
