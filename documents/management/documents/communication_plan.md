## Team Communication

Our team conducts meetings every days we are all together. This meetings serves to:
- Review the accomplishments of the previous workday.
- Plan the objectives for the current day. 
- Makes sure everyone is at the same page on the project.
- Answer all possible upcoming questions regarding the project's state.

By the end of every week a small meeting is organized to check team's current moral states, and what has been achieved the entire week. <br>
This practice helps enhance the content of our weekly reports on a regular basis.


## Communication with the Client

We maintain communication with our client through emails or messages using the [Slack](https://slack.com). When necessary, we reach out via email or messages to arrange meetings with the client for more in-depth interaction.

This revised format enhances clarity and structure for better readability of the project.
