## All Risks and Mitigation Plans 

> ### **1. Client changes requirements**
>  
> The client can unexpectedly change the requirements which could cause possible delay if the work with the previous requirements was done. 

> ### Mitigation Plan
> 
> To mitigate this possible issue, regular meeting and Q&As between the client and us are put in place, ensuring client's satisfaction on the current work.

> ### **2. Team member absences**
>  
> Team members may have personal issues or Illnesses that causes inaccessibility which could make the workload for the others heavier. 

> ### Mitigation Plan
> 
> The absent team members are recommended to work over time or during their absence to regain the lost hours of work. For the absent team members that are able to work remotely has to work at home and be present at an online meeting at the beginning of the work hours.

> ### **3. Inadequate risk management**
>  
> If a risk isn't identified and mitigated when it's needed it could lead to unexpected issues, delays or getting failures during the project.

> ### Mitigation Plan
> 
> Documented procedures like this document allows to indentify, mitigate and manage risks efficiently. Keeping a constant communication between team members is mandatory to locate and identify risks.
