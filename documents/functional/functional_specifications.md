### 1.1 Project Overview

The aim of the project is to create a software that find the quickest path between two landmarks in the United States. To achieve this request, we have to use the C++ language[^1]. We decide to name our software "QPS", aka "Quickest Path System", a played of words among GPS "Global Positioning System" and the name of the project "Quickest Path".

### 1.2 Document Purpose

This document is here to provide all the functional specification of the project. We will cover topics such as who is able to use the software, how you can use the software (briefly), how it functionally works and the features we decide to skip for now but which can be implemented later.
If you reach for technical aspects of the project, such as how the C++ works, the project conventions, how the algorithm is use specifically, please refer you to the [technical specification](../technical/technical_specification.md)

### 1.3 Personas

**Workers** : All the workers who use an application to commute in order to avoid traffic jams and take the shortest/quickest route.
**Travel buffs** : Persons who love travel around his country or the world and want to find the quickest way to go to his destination.
**Map enthusiasts** : All the people who adore maps and love being part of a user community for a specific application.

### 1.4 Stakeholders and Representatives

| Representative           | Role   | Expectation                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Franck JEANNIN (ALGOSUP) | Client | Project timelines respected and a usable software at the end |

## 2. Application Overview

In this section, we will talk about the software (in broad outline). To do this, some technical terms are going to be employed to ensure the consistency of the explanations. If you don't know the used worlds, you can take a gaze to the Glossary at the end (by the little chips next to them).

### 2.1 What is our software used for?<!--Like a GPS to move between 2 points-->

The software is a GPS like, a software that use some algorithms[^2] to define for you the quickest path between two points, landmarks to be precise. When you start it, after some verifications on our side, it will be ask you to enter your current place and where you want to go. The answer will be send in a specific format (JSON[^3] or XML[^4]) and you will be able to know the optimized path.
To know the error rate or any percentage directly link to a performance section, please look at [3.1 Hardware](#31-hardware).

### 2.2 What the application used to work?<!--The Algorithm (can be explained with a graph), the code (language) and more-->

To operate, the software is based on algorithms, a finite sequence of specific instructions, the Dijkstra[^5] one. Here is a graph to explain how the algorithm works:
<center>

![Dijkstra Algorithm](..\images\functional\Disjktsra_Algorithm.gif) </center>

The final result looks like this --> <img src="..\images\functional\Final_Dijkstra.png" alt="Dijkstra Final Path" style="width: 250px">

Since this algorithm is needed to be implement by each person when he created his code to use it, we decided to code ours using the C++ language[^6].

## 3. Software Aspects

This section will treat about the software performances, its interface and how we have turn the technical aspects into a user friendly interface into the command prompt[^7], an important aspect to avoid the user to be lost.

### 3.1 Performance

The software have to respects criteria to be competitive and follow ours objectives. Once you've initialized the verification file (including the landmarks), the command prompt must finish the checking as fast as possible, depending of the file size.
Before you're writing your route, a pre-processing method has to be made to ensure the rapidity of the program once you want to research for the quickest path.
When you enter your depart point and your destination, the API[^8] must respond within 1 second.
Finally, the software have to indicate you the most optimized path/the quickest path, without exceeding a margin of error of 10%. This isn't verifiable on your side, this is why we strive to offer you the best service as possible!

### 3.2 User Interface (aka UI)<!--UI is a nice to have but we have already the plan-->

#### A. Definition
Here, we will more speak as an interface than an UI strictly speaking because the latter is a nice to have, a future improvement (please take a gaze to the [7. Future improvements](#7-future-improvements) to know all enhancements we have planned to add so far).

#### B. Verification
While you're waiting for the verification precess, a percentage bar will be displayed to don't leave you in the dark. After 10 seconds, if the bar didn't progress of any percent, please restart the verification.

#### C. Main program
All the operations will happen on the command prompt (the major interface of the software). Once the pre-processing is done and your starting point defined as well as your arrival point on the command prompt, an answer in the form of the JSON[^4] format (by default) will be displayed.

<!--Can be organized in major points-->

### 3.3 Signature<!--What I made Friday-->

To ensure you have correctly downloaded our software, we added a signature/logo into the interface on the command prompt as you can see just below
![The command prompt Signature](..\images\functional\CMD_Signature.png)
We also add a signature into the code (check the [technical specification](../technical/technical_specification.md) for further information) much more difficult to spot and remove.

If this logo and our signature aren't here, you've probably downloaded a counterfeit software!

## 4. How to use it?<!--How to use it briefly (use the command prompt e.g.) but not how use it clearly-->

## 5. Platforms compatibility<!--Platforms where the software are used and sure to be used on-->

<!--Can transform the following under-titles in a array ; ALSO, indicate that the mobile platforms won't be compatible with the software for now-->

### 5.1 Windows

### 5.2 MacOS

## 6. Functional requirements

### 6.1 REST API implementation

### 6.2 Verification processing

## 7. Non-functional requirements

### 7.1 Response/Performance & Reliability

### 7.2 Testability<!--Redirecting through the Test plan is a good thing-->

### 7.3 Flexibility<!--The possibility to implement/improve our software ; can indicate that i'm going to develop on the Future Improvement just after-->

## 8. Future improvements
