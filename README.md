<br>

## üìñ About
Quickest Path System (or **QPS**) is a terminal programm and was developed as a team project for Algosup. It allows to find the quickest path in time from a landmark A to a landmark B.
<br>

## ‚å®Ô∏è Programming language

This project has been conceived using C++ programming language.
<br>
<br>

## ‚úèÔ∏è üìã Details
We had approximately 5 weeks to complete the project, during which we implemented:

- A Data Verification tool: 

- A path finding algorithm 

- A REST API
<br>

The project was an excellent opportunity to understand how data structures and algorithm works which are essential in today's world.
<br>

## üöÄ How to launch the programs?

### Launch the CSV Verification Code

#### For MacOS

- Navigate to the directory containing the CSV file and the source code:
    - bash
    - cd csv
- Compile the C++ verification program using clang++:<br>
    - bash
    - clang++ -std=c++11 verification.cpp -o verification
 - Run the compiled program:
    - bash
    - ./verification
    <br><br>

#### For Windows

- Open a Command Prompt or Terminal and navigate to the directory containing the CSV file and the source code:
    - cmd
    - cd csv
- Compile the C++ verification program using g++ (or your preferred compiler):
    - cmd
    - g++ -std=c++11 verification.cpp -o verification.exe
- Run the compiled program:
    - cmd
    - verification.exe


#### Running the Program in VS Code Terminal

First, ensure you have a compiler installed:

#### For MacOS
macOS comes with a pre-installed compiler. To verify:
- Open a terminal.
- Type the following command:
    - bash
    - g++ --version

You should see output similar to this:

`yaml`

`Apple clang version 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.6)
Target: arm64-apple-darwin24.2.0
Thread model: posix
InstalledDir: /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin`

- Ensure you see the line:
    - scss 
    - Apple clang version 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.6)

- If the compiler is not installed, install Xcode Command Line Tools by running:
    - bash
    - xcode-select --install

#### For Windows

Windows does not have a built-in compiler. You will need to install MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows). Follow these steps:

- Download MinGW: Visit MinGW Installation Guide or download directly from SourceForge.

- Install MinGW:
During installation, ensure you select the options to install the C++ compiler.

- Add the bin directory of MinGW to your system‚Äôs PATH environment variable. This allows you to use the g++ command from any terminal.

- Verify Installation: Open Command Prompt and run:
    - bash
    - g++ --version

    You should see something like:

`csharp`

`g++ (x86_64-posix-seh-rev0, Built by MinGW-W64 project) 8.1.0`

#### Steps to Compile and Run the Program

You can compile and run the program directly in the terminal of Visual Studio Code after cloning the repository:

- Open the repository folder in VS Code.
- Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+** on Windows/Linux, **Cmd+ on macOS).
- Compile the program:
    - bash
    - g++ -std=c++11 verification.cpp -o verification
- Run the program:
    - bash
    - ./verification

#### Additional Notes:
If you encounter any issues with the compiler setup on Windows, refer to the official
MinGW InstallationDocumentation.

On macOS, the default clang++ compiler supports the -std=c++11 flag, so no additional setup should be required.
